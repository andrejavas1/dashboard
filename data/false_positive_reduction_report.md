## Recommendations

1. **Continue using false positive reduction techniques** - The techniques are effective at reducing false positives.

2. **Pattern diversity is well-maintained** - The enhanced patterns maintain good diversity across feature categories.

3. **Deploy enhanced pattern discovery** - The enhanced approach shows overall improvement and should be used in production.

## Conclusion

The false positive reduction validation compared pattern discovery with and without enhanced false positive reduction techniques. The results demonstrate that the enhanced approach successfully reduces false positives while maintaining pattern diversity and overall quality. The statistical significance testing, regime coverage filtering, and strict false positive rate thresholds contribute to more reliable patterns.
