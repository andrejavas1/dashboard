# APM Task Assignment: Performance Benchmarking

## Task Reference
Implementation Plan: **Task 1.3 - Performance Benchmarking** assigned to **Agent_Validation**

## Context from Dependencies
This task depends on Task 1.1 Output by Agent_CodebaseRefactor. You will need to review the codebase analysis report to understand the existing implementation for benchmarking.

## Objective
Establish baseline performance metrics for current pattern discovery capabilities.

## Detailed Instructions
Complete all items in one response:
- Execute existing pattern discovery scripts to measure current success rates and frequency
- Analyze false positive rates and pattern diversity in current implementation
- Document baseline performance metrics for comparison with improved versions
- Create benchmark reports with quantitative measurements and visualizations

## Expected Output
- Deliverables: Benchmark reports with quantitative measurements of success rates, frequency, and key metrics
- Success criteria: Comprehensive baseline metrics for current pattern discovery performance
- File locations: Benchmark report in data/performance_benchmark_report.md

## Memory Logging
Upon completion, you **MUST** log work in: `.apm/Memory/Phase_01_Assessment_Analysis/Task_1_3_Performance_Benchmarking.md`
Follow .apm/guides/Memory_Log_Guide.md instructions.

## Reporting Protocol
After logging, you **MUST** output a **Final Task Report** code block.
- **Format:** Use the exact template provided in your .roo/commands/apm-3-initiate-implementation.md instructions.
- **Perspective:** Write it from the User's perspective so they can copy-paste it back to the Manager.
