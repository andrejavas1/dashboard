# APM Task Assignment: Performance Optimization

## Task Reference
Implementation Plan: **Task 6.2 - Performance Optimization** assigned to **Agent_CodebaseRefactor**

## Context from Dependencies
This task depends on Task 6.1 Output. You will need to review the integrated system to identify performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.

## Objective
Optimize the integrated system for better performance and efficiency.

## Detailed Instructions
Complete all items in one response:
- Profile the integrated system to identify performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- Optimize algorithms and data processing for better speed and resource utilization
- Implement caching and other performance enhancement techniques where appropriate
- Create performance benchmarks and optimization documentation with best practices

## Expected Output
- Deliverables: Performance improvements that enhance system speed and resource utilization
- Success criteria: Measurable performance gains with documented benchmarks
- File locations: Performance optimization in src/performance_optimizer.py and documentation in docs/performance_guide.md

## Memory Logging
Upon completion, you **MUST** log work in: `.apm/Memory/Phase_06_Integration_Optimization/Task_6_2_Performance_Optimization.md`
Follow .apm/guides/Memory_Log_Guide.md instructions.

## Reporting Protocol
After logging, you **MUST** output a **Final Task Report** code block.
- **Format:** Use the exact template provided in your .roo/commands/apm-3-initiate-implementation.md instructions.
- **Perspective:** Write it from the User's perspective so they can copy-paste it back to the Manager.
