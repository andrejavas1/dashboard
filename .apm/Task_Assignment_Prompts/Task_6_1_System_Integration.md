# APM Task Assignment: System Integration

## Task Reference
Implementation Plan: **Task 6.1 - System Integration** assigned to **Agent_CodebaseRefactor**

## Context from Dependencies
This task depends on Task 5.3 Output by Agent_Visualization. You will need to review the real-time monitoring system implementation to understand how to integrate it with other components.

## Objective
Integrate all enhanced components into a cohesive pattern discovery system.

## Detailed Instructions
Complete all items in one response:
- Integrate all enhanced components (ML patterns, rule-based patterns, validation framework) into a cohesive system
- Develop interfaces and APIs for component communication and data flow
- Implement comprehensive testing to ensure all components work together correctly
- Create integration documentation with system architecture and usage guidelines

## Expected Output
- Deliverables: Fully integrated system with all improved components working together
- Success criteria: All components integrated seamlessly with proper data flow and interfaces
- File locations: Integration system in src/integrated_system.py and documentation in docs/integration_guide.md

## Memory Logging
Upon completion, you **MUST** log work in: `.apm/Memory/Phase_06_Integration_Optimization/Task_6_1_System_Integration.md`
Follow .apm/guides/Memory_Log_Guide.md instructions.

## Reporting Protocol
After logging, you **MUST** output a **Final Task Report** code block.
- **Format:** Use the exact template provided in your .roo/commands/apm-3-initiate-implementation.md instructions.
- **Perspective:** Write it from the User's perspective so they can copy-paste it back to the Manager.
