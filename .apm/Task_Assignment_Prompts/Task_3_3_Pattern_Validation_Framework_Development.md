# APM Task Assignment: Pattern Validation Framework Development

## Task Reference
Implementation Plan: **Task 3.3 - Pattern Validation Framework Development** assigned to **Agent_Validation**

## Context from Dependencies
This task depends on Task 3.1 Output by Agent_PatternDiscovery and Task 3.2 Output by Agent_PatternDiscovery. You will need to review the ML-based and rule-based pattern discovery implementations to understand what needs to be validated.

## Objective
Develop a comprehensive validation framework for evaluating pattern quality.

## Detailed Instructions
Complete all items in one response:
- Develop a comprehensive validation framework to measure pattern success rate and frequency
- Implement tools to track false positive rates and pattern diversity metrics
- Create automated testing procedures for evaluating new pattern discovery methods
- Document validation procedures with examples and best practices

## Expected Output
- Deliverables: Validation tools that measure success rate, frequency, and other key metrics
- Success criteria: Comprehensive validation framework that can measure all required metrics
- File locations: Validation framework code in src/pattern_validation_framework.py and documentation in docs/validation_framework.md

## Memory Logging
Upon completion, you **MUST** log work in: `.apm/Memory/Phase_03_Pattern_Discovery_Implementation/Task_3_3_Pattern_Validation_Framework_Development.md`
Follow .apm/guides/Memory_Log_Guide.md instructions.

## Reporting Protocol
After logging, you **MUST** output a **Final Task Report** code block.
- **Format:** Use the exact template provided in your .roo/commands/apm-3-initiate-implementation.md instructions.
- **Perspective:** Write it from the User's perspective so they can copy-paste it back to the Manager.
