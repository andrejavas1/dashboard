# APM Task Assignment: Feature Engineering Optimization

## Task Reference
Implementation Plan: **Task 2.2 - Feature Engineering Optimization** assigned to **Agent_DataEngineering**

## Context from Dependencies
This task depends on Task 2.1 Output. You will need to review the enhanced data acquisition pipeline to understand the new capabilities and data sources available for feature engineering.

## Objective
Optimize feature engineering processes to support data-driven pattern discovery.

## Detailed Instructions
Complete all items in one response:
- Optimize existing feature engineering code in src/phase3_feature_engineering.py for better performance
- Add new technical indicators and features that support data-driven discovery
- Implement feature selection mechanisms to identify most predictive indicators
- Create comprehensive documentation for all features and their calculation methods

## Expected Output
- Deliverables: Improved feature calculation methods with better performance and extensibility
- Success criteria: Faster feature calculation with additional predictive features
- File locations: Enhanced feature engineering code in src/phase3_feature_engineering.py and documentation in docs/feature_engineering.md

## Memory Logging
Upon completion, you **MUST** log work in: `.apm/Memory/Phase_02_Data_Pipeline_Enhancement/Task_2_2_Feature_Engineering_Optimization.md`
Follow .apm/guides/Memory_Log_Guide.md instructions.

## Reporting Protocol
After logging, you **MUST** output a **Final Task Report** code block.
- **Format:** Use the exact template provided in your .roo/commands/apm-3-initiate-implementation.md instructions.
- **Perspective:** Write it from the User's perspective so they can copy-paste it back to the Manager.
