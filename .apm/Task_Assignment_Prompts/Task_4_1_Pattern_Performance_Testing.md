# APM Task Assignment: Pattern Performance Testing

## Task Reference
Implementation Plan: **Task 4.1 - Pattern Performance Testing** assigned to **Agent_Validation**

## Context from Dependencies
This task depends on Task 3.3 Output. You will need to review the pattern validation framework in src/pattern_validation_framework.py and documentation in docs/validation_framework.md to understand how to conduct comprehensive performance testing.

## Objective
Conduct comprehensive testing of improved pattern discovery methods to ensure quality metrics.

## Detailed Instructions
Complete all items in one response:
- Execute comprehensive tests on improved pattern discovery methods to measure success rates
- Analyze pattern frequency to ensure 12+ occurrences per year requirement is met
- Compare performance of ML-based vs rule-based approaches with detailed metrics
- Generate performance reports with visualizations and statistical analysis

## Expected Output
- Deliverables: Detailed performance reports and validation results meeting >80% success rate requirement
- Success criteria: Comprehensive performance analysis with clear metrics and visualizations
- File locations: Performance reports in data/performance_analysis_report.md and visualizations in charts/

## Memory Logging
Upon completion, you **MUST** log work in: `.apm/Memory/Phase_04_Validation_Testing/Task_4_1_Pattern_Performance_Testing.md`
Follow .apm/guides/Memory_Log_Guide.md instructions.

## Reporting Protocol
After logging, you **MUST** output a **Final Task Report** code block.
- **Format:** Use the exact template provided in your .roo/commands/apm-3-initiate-implementation.md instructions.
- **Perspective:** Write it from the User's perspective so they can copy-paste it back to the Manager.
