# APM Task Assignment: Real-Time Monitoring System

## Task Reference
Implementation Plan: **Task 5.3 - Real-Time Monitoring System** assigned to **Agent_Visualization**

## Context from Dependencies
This task depends on Task 5.2 Output. You will need to review the pattern visualization implementation to understand how to integrate real-time monitoring with the visualization components.

## Objective
Develop a real-time monitoring system for pattern detection and alerts.

## Detailed Instructions
Complete all items in one response:
- Develop a real-time monitoring system for tracking pattern occurrences and generating alerts
- Implement alerting mechanisms for high-probability pattern detections
- Add monitoring dashboards for tracking system performance and pattern activity
- Create documentation for system setup, configuration, and maintenance

## Expected Output
- Deliverables: Monitoring tools that track pattern occurrences and generate alerts
- Success criteria: Real-time monitoring system with alerting capabilities and performance tracking
- File locations: Monitoring system in src/real_time_monitor.py and documentation in docs/monitoring_guide.md

## Memory Logging
Upon completion, you **MUST** log work in: `.apm/Memory/Phase_05_Visualization_Monitoring/Task_5_3_Real_Time_Monitoring_System.md`
Follow .apm/guides/Memory_Log_Guide.md instructions.

## Reporting Protocol
After logging, you **MUST** output a **Final Task Report** code block.
- **Format:** Use the exact template provided in your .roo/commands/apm-3-initiate-implementation.md instructions.
- **Perspective:** Write it from the User's perspective so they can copy-paste it back to the Manager.
