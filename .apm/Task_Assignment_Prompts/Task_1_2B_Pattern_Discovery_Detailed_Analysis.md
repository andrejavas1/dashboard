# APM Task Assignment: Pattern Discovery Detailed Analysis

## Task Reference
Implementation Plan: **Task 1.2 - Pattern Discovery Algorithm Assessment** (Continuation) assigned to **Agent_PatternDiscovery**

## Context from Dependencies
This task depends on Task 1.2A Output. You will need to review the pattern discovery methods summary document to understand which methods to analyze in detail.

## Objective
Conduct detailed analysis of the most critical pattern discovery methods identified in the summary.

## Detailed Instructions
Complete all items in one response:
- Analyze the top 3-5 most critical pattern discovery methods identified in the summary
- Evaluate the effectiveness of each approach using available performance data
- Compare machine learning potential versus rule-based approaches for these methods
- Document findings with specific recommendations for algorithmic improvements

## Expected Output
- Deliverables: Detailed analysis of critical pattern discovery methods with enhancement recommendations
- Success criteria: Thorough evaluation of key methods with actionable improvement suggestions
- File locations: Detailed analysis report in data/pattern_discovery_detailed_analysis.md

## Memory Logging
Upon completion, you **MUST** log work in: `.apm/Memory/Phase_01_Assessment_Analysis/Task_1_2B_Pattern_Discovery_Detailed_Analysis.md`
Follow .apm/guides/Memory_Log_Guide.md instructions.

## Reporting Protocol
After logging, you **MUST** output a **Final Task Report** code block.
- **Format:** Use the exact template provided in your .roo/commands/apm-3-initiate-implementation.md instructions.
- **Perspective:** Write it from the User's perspective so they can copy-paste it back to the Manager.
