# APM Task Assignment: Technical Indicator Library Development

## Task Reference
Implementation Plan: **Task 2.3 - Technical Indicator Library Development** assigned to **Agent_DataEngineering**

## Context from Dependencies
This task depends on Task 2.1 Output. You will need to review the enhanced data acquisition pipeline to understand the data sources and formats available for technical indicator calculations.

## Objective
Create a comprehensive technical indicator library to support enhanced pattern discovery.

## Detailed Instructions
Complete all items in one response:
- Develop a comprehensive library of technical indicators with consistent interfaces
- Implement both traditional indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands) and advanced indicators
- Add unit tests for all indicators to ensure accuracy and reliability
- Create detailed documentation with usage examples and mathematical formulas

## Expected Output
- Deliverables: Well-documented library of technical indicators with consistent interfaces
- Success criteria: Comprehensive, reliable, and well-tested technical indicator library
- File locations: Technical indicator library in src/technical_indicators.py and tests in tests/test_technical_indicators.py

## Memory Logging
Upon completion, you **MUST** log work in: `.apm/Memory/Phase_02_Data_Pipeline_Enhancement/Task_2_3_Technical_Indicator_Library_Development.md`
Follow .apm/guides/Memory_Log_Guide.md instructions.

## Reporting Protocol
After logging, you **MUST** output a **Final Task Report** code block.
- **Format:** Use the exact template provided in your .roo/commands/apm-3-initiate-implementation.md instructions.
- **Perspective:** Write it from the User's perspective so they can copy-paste it back to the Manager.
