# APM Task Assignment: Data Acquisition Pipeline Enhancement

## Task Reference
Implementation Plan: **Task 2.1 - Data Acquisition Pipeline Enhancement** assigned to **Agent_DataEngineering**

## Objective
Improve data acquisition capabilities to support enhanced pattern discovery.

## Detailed Instructions
Complete all items in one response:
- Enhance existing data acquisition pipeline in src/data_acquisition.py with better error handling and validation
- Add support for additional technical indicators and data sources if needed
- Implement data quality checks and automatic recovery mechanisms
- Create documentation for the enhanced pipeline and usage examples

## Expected Output
- Deliverables: Enhanced data pipeline with better error handling, validation, and extensibility
- Success criteria: More robust and reliable data acquisition with improved error handling
- File locations: Enhanced data acquisition code in src/data_acquisition.py and documentation in docs/data_pipeline.md

## Memory Logging
Upon completion, you **MUST** log work in: `.apm/Memory/Phase_02_Data_Pipeline_Enhancement/Task_2_1_Data_Acquisition_Pipeline_Enhancement.md`
Follow .apm/guides/Memory_Log_Guide.md instructions.

## Reporting Protocol
After logging, you **MUST** output a **Final Task Report** code block.
- **Format:** Use the exact template provided in your .roo/commands/apm-3-initiate-implementation.md instructions.
- **Perspective:** Write it from the User's perspective so they can copy-paste it back to the Manager.
