# APM Task Assignment: Cross-Validation Implementation

## Task Reference
Implementation Plan: **Task 4.3 - Cross-Validation Implementation** assigned to **Agent_Validation**

## Context from Dependencies
This task depends on Task 4.1 Output. You will need to review the pattern performance testing results to understand the patterns that need cross-validation and their performance characteristics.

## Objective
Implement cross-validation procedures to ensure pattern robustness across time periods.

## Detailed Instructions
Complete all items in one response:
- Implement cross-validation procedures to test pattern robustness across different time periods
- Develop testing frameworks for evaluating pattern performance on out-of-sample data
- Analyze pattern stability and consistency across various market conditions
- Document cross-validation procedures with examples and best practices

## Expected Output
- Deliverables: Cross-validation frameworks and robustness testing results
- Success criteria: Comprehensive cross-validation framework with robustness analysis
- File locations: Cross-validation framework in src/cross_validation_framework.py and documentation in docs/cross_validation.md

## Memory Logging
Upon completion, you **MUST** log work in: `.apm/Memory/Phase_04_Validation_Testing/Task_4_3_Cross_Validation_Implementation.md`
Follow .apm/guides/Memory_Log_Guide.md instructions.

## Reporting Protocol
After logging, you **MUST** output a **Final Task Report** code block.
- **Format:** Use the exact template provided in your .roo/commands/apm-3-initiate-implementation.md instructions.
- **Perspective:** Write it from the User's perspective so they can copy-paste it back to the Manager.
