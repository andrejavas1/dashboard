# APM Task Assignment: Rule-Based Pattern Enhancement

## Task Reference
Implementation Plan: **Task 3.2 - Rule-Based Pattern Enhancement** assigned to **Agent_PatternDiscovery**

## Context from Dependencies
This task depends on Task 2.2 Output by Agent_DataEngineering. You will need to review the enhanced feature engineering capabilities in src/phase3_feature_engineering.py and the documentation in docs/feature_engineering.md to understand the available features for rule-based pattern discovery.

## Objective
Enhance existing rule-based pattern discovery methods for better performance.

## Detailed Instructions
Complete all items in one response:
- Enhance existing rule-based pattern discovery methods in src/context7_high_success_patterns.py and related files
- Implement techniques to reduce false positives while maintaining pattern diversity
- Optimize rule generation and evaluation for better performance and accuracy
- Create comprehensive documentation for enhanced rule-based approaches

## Expected Output
- Deliverables: Improved rule-based algorithms with better performance and reduced false positives
- Success criteria: Enhanced rule-based patterns with reduced false positives while maintaining pattern diversity
- File locations: Enhanced rule-based pattern code in src/enhanced_rule_based_patterns.py and documentation in docs/rule_based_patterns.md

## Memory Logging
Upon completion, you **MUST** log work in: `.apm/Memory/Phase_03_Pattern_Discovery_Implementation/Task_3_2_Rule_Based_Pattern_Enhancement.md`
Follow .apm/guides/Memory_Log_Guide.md instructions.

## Reporting Protocol
After logging, you **MUST** output a **Final Task Report** code block.
- **Format:** Use the exact template provided in your .roo/commands/apm-3-initiate-implementation.md instructions.
- **Perspective:** Write it from the User's perspective so they can copy-paste it back to the Manager.
