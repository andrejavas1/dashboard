# APM Task Assignment: Codebase Consolidation

## Task Reference
Implementation Plan: **Task 6.3 - Codebase Consolidation** assigned to **Agent_CodebaseRefactor**

## Context from Dependencies
This task depends on Task 6.2 Output. You will need to review the performance optimization results to understand how to consolidate the codebase while maintaining performance improvements.

## Objective
Consolidate the codebase to remove redundancy and simplify implementation.

## Detailed Instructions
Complete all items in one response:
- Refactor and consolidate the codebase to remove redundancy and simplify implementation
- Remove duplicate pattern discovery methods and components identified in Phase 1
- Simplify system architecture while maintaining all required functionality
- Create consolidated documentation with clear code organization and usage guidelines

## Expected Output
- Deliverables: Clean, simplified codebase with reduced complexity
- Success criteria: Reduced code duplication, simplified architecture, all functionality preserved
- File locations: Consolidated codebase with updated documentation in docs/codebase_guide.md

## Memory Logging
Upon completion, you **MUST** log work in: `.apm/Memory/Phase_06_Integration_Optimization/Task_6_3_Codebase_Consolidation.md`
Follow .apm/guides/Memory_Log_Guide.md instructions.

## Reporting Protocol
After logging, you **MUST** output a **Final Task Report** code block.
- **Format:** Use the exact template provided in your .roo/commands/apm-3-initiate-implementation.md instructions.
- **Perspective:** Write it from the User's perspective so they can copy-paste it back to the Manager.
