## 🎯 CONTENT OVERLAP (Intentional)

Some content appears in multiple documents by design:

- **5 Critical Issues** appear in: FINAL_SUMMARY, REVIEW_SUMMARY, PROJECT_ANALYSIS, VISUAL_SUMMARY
- **Implementation Timeline** appears in: INDEX, IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE, PROJECT_ANALYSIS
- **Expected Metrics** appear in: FINAL_SUMMARY, REVIEW_SUMMARY, PROJECT_ANALYSIS, CODE_EXAMPLES
- **Configuration Changes** appear in: IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE, CODE_EXAMPLES

This allows each document to stand alone while maintaining consistency.
